## Problem
Businesses have a large amount of data they are not able to extract insights from. Cleaning the data (70% of the work) requires technical skills and is unenjoyable. Extracting insights (30% of the work) requires a combination of technical and business skills which leads to long back-and-forth and low-impact decisions.  

## Solution
Processly is a self-service data workspace for businesses that eliminates the grunt work out of data cleaning and removes the guesswork out of insight extraction to enable fast, reliable, and impactful decision-making. 
With the help of AI, Processly
- Makes zero-code data cleaning repeatable, auditable, and user-friendly
- Makes zero-code analysis guided and decision-focused


## About: "Data Shouldn't Be This Hard"
### Who am I
- I'm a data scientist and business analyst who has spent countless hours helping companies make sense of their data. I've worked extensively with data cleaning, analysis, dashboards, Machine Learning models, and now building data-driven products.

### Why I started Processly

- Every business has immense potential value locked in its data. However, cleaning data requires technical skills, and asking the right questions demands both business and technical expertise.
- Most business analysis work isn't directly related to decision-making—it's preprocessing like cleaning, organizing, and exploration. As a business analysis professional, I wanted a tool to handle this less creative process—the grunt work. The Data Workspace is that tool.
